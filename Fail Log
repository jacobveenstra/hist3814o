First Fail of Module 2 would be searching for information on any dead relatives from the Common Wars Grave Commission. Not only no Veenstras from The Netherlands, but also, no Veenstras from Canada. 
My second fail would be trying to figure out how to put this information into the Dbox.
third fail: I cannot not figure out how to do exercise 2 as I cannot figure out how to work this Dbox, or where i put this information in
figured out how to use the DBox, having some troubles with the nano text and how to save the information that i received from the common wars gave commission
starting to get more comfortable with the Dbox, although sometimes it has me losing my patience
exercise 3 was alot of trouble...still not exactly sure how to vet the websites
